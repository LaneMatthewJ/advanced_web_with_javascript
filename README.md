# Advanced Web Development with Javascript!

This course will take us from an introduction to NodeJS assuming minimal knowledge of Javascript to working with React and Redux frameworks for front end architecture. We will then move from working with front end frameworks toward working with the back end framework Express. With our backend work set up, we will then discuss in relative detail the costs and benefits of using relational databases (e.g. postgres) vs document stores (e.g. mongo). Finally, we will then combine both front and backend frameworks in one application to create an entire web application, and then break the application into two separate applications to discuss the benefits of micro service architecture. 

Throughout this course, we will be working with many tools students have previously not used, and be pulling in open sourced modules, creating our own modules, and deploying our applications to the web. While this course is defined as “Web Development with Advanced Javascript” many of the supplementary concepts will build off of knowledge of shell scripting, basic database queries (e.g. SQL/JSON), and many, many configuration files. Additionally, because of the nature of this type of programming, all students will be expected to use *git*, a source control language. 

NodeJS webapps are extremely powerful, though have a steep learning curve. By the end of this course, you should feel comfortable in creating your own deployable webapps with React/Redux front ends, and Express backends.
